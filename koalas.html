                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the 
                    leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because
                    this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric 
                    content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20
                    hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bondingexists only 
                    between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males 
                    communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and
                    attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from
                    scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, 
                    koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into 
                    their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to
                    seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as 
                    joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few 
                    natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by 
                    various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the
                    koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.

                    <p>Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted
                    in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded 
                    encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an
                    image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist 
                    George Perry. Botanist Robert Brownwrote the first detailed 
                    scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his
                    work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John
                    Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the
                    species to the general British public. Further details about
                    the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by 
                    several English scientists. Because of its distinctive 
                    appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of
                    Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the 
                    International Union for Conservation of Nature.[1] The
                    Australian government similarly lists specific populations in 
                    Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable.[5] The animal
                    was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and 
                    large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public 
                    outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species.
                    Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved
                    to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or
                    reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat
                    destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.</p>
